Who's that Pokemon?
- The goal of this challenge is to show the shadow of a Pokemon once start is clicked while having a Timer that gives 10 seconds for someone to guess the Pokemon. Once the timer reaches 0 display the undarkened image of the Pokemon along with the name.
- The fetch from the Poke API is already complete and all the information you need from it is provided.
- This challenge will require you to utilize React's lifecycle methods

Suggested work flow
- Find a way to darken the image of the pokemon
- Create a Timer that counts down from 10 to 0
    - Make sure the timer does not start until the Start button is pushed
    - Make sure the timer does not go into the negatives
- Once the timer reaches 0 the pokemon image should be undarkened and the name should be displayed
- Find a way to make the game restart each time the button is pushed (you should not need to refresh the page)

-If you finish early see what else you can add to this!
